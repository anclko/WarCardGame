Welcome To The War Game!
========================

Rules Of The Game.
-----------------

The goal of the game is to eventually win all of the cards. 
War is generally played between two people, but up to four people can play. 
The ranking for cards in War from highest to lowest is A K Q J T (10) 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2. 
Nothing beats an Ace and a 2 beats nothing.

In the basic game there are two players and you use a standard 52 card pack. 
Cards rank as usual from high to low: A K Q J T 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2. 
Suits are ignored in this game.

Deal out all the cards, so that each player has 26. 
Players do not look at their cards, but keep them in a packet face down. 
The object of the game is to win all the cards.

Both players now turn their top card face up and put them on the table. 
Whoever turned the higher card takes both cards and adds them (face down) to the bottom 
of their packet. Then both players turn up their next card and so on.

If the turned up cards are equal there is a war. 
The tied cards stay on the table and both players play the next card 
of their pile face down and then another card face-up. 
Whoever has the higher of the new face-up cards wins the war and 
adds all cards won to the bottom of their packet. 
If the new face-up cards are equal as well, the war continues: each player puts 
another card face-down and one face-up. The war goes on like this as 
long as the face-up cards continue to be equal. As soon as they are different 
the player of the higher card wins all the cards in the war.

The game continues until one player has all the cards and wins. 
This can take a long time.

If you don't have enough cards to complete the war, you lose. 
If neither player has enough cards, the one who runs out first loses.
